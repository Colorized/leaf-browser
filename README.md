This is a fork of Leaf Browser Alpha. Unfortunately, this and all other forks and republishes of this app have been blocked on most school networks. I'm seeing if I can change the key info to make a different version and make it work. No clue how extensions and apps work on chrome OS though, so this might take a while.
